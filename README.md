# Weekly PBM regulatory meeting template. 

# PrepForMeeting Crew
Welcome to the PrepForMeeting Crew project , powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

1. First lock the dependencies and then install them:
```bash
uv lock
```
```bash
uv sync
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

-Modified for PBM Stub Project - Arkansas only but can loop through states max cost impact <$0.05 per state per week.

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```
or
```bash
uv run prep_for_meeting
```

This command initializes the prep-for-meeting Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The prep-for-meeting Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
